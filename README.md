# Blood_Share

**Blood_Share** is a Virtual Blood Bank web app, that aims at providing mechanism for people in need to directly talk to willing donors, and also find out blood availability in nearby blood banks.
On this platform people willing to donate blood can sign up with details of their blood groups, location. Also thereâ€™ll be accounts of blood banks with details like number of packages of blood available and blood group, location of blood bank to filter out nearest blood banks.
You can find the project's wireframe below which depicts the basic flow of our web application.


## How to launch the app locally?
* Step1 -- Fork the project repo and clone it in your local directory
```
Note : You can directly update the frontend components inside public\ directory
but we have used gulp to automate the process. You need not to refresh the page after each change
or go to codepen to check your changes you made in scss or html or js files. Just run gulp and have fun.
```
* Step2 -- Download and install Node(latest stable version) (npm comes along with node)<br />
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) -- (e.g v 8.11 )
<br />[What is npm?](https://www.npmjs.com/)
```
verify with below command
>>>node -v
>>>npm -v
```
* Make sure you run all your commands fron inside cloned /Blood_Share folder
* Step3 -- Install the npm modules from the package.json
```
>>> npm install
this command installs all the node related packages required to run the app locally in
/node_modules folder. You can see this folder inside /Blood_Share folder after running npm install
```
* Step4 -- No more steps
```
Now you don't need to repeat above steps always to run the app rather its one time task.
But if you clone the project in new location then again you need to repeat step 3(only).
